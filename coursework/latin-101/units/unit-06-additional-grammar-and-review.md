## Lesson 6.1: The Ablative Case - Major Uses

The **ablative case** is the most versatile case in Latin, with numerous functions. We've already seen it in prepositional phrases; now we'll explore its other uses.

### 1. Ablative of Means/Instrument

Shows **by what means** or **with what instrument** something is done (no preposition in Latin).

**English:** "by," "with," "by means of"

**Examples:**
- *Mīlitēs gladiīs pugnant.* = The soldiers fight **with swords**.
- *Oculīs videō.* = I see **with (my) eyes**.
- *Sagittīs hostēs vincit.* = He conquers the enemy **with arrows**.

### 2. Ablative of Manner

Shows **how** or **in what manner** something is done.

**With an adjective:** No preposition needed
- *Magnā cūrā labōrat.* = He works **with great care**.

**Without an adjective:** Usually uses *cum*
- *Cum cūrā labōrat.* = He works **with care**.

**Note:** *Cum* can be attached to personal pronouns: *mēcum* (with me), *tēcum* (with you), *nōbīscum* (with us), *vōbīscum* (with you pl.)

### 3. Ablative of Accompaniment

Shows **with whom** something is done (always uses *cum*).

**Examples:**
- *Cum amīcīs ambulō.* = I walk **with (my) friends**.
- *Cum patre venit.* = He comes **with (his) father**.

### 4. Ablative of Time When

Shows **when** something happens (no preposition).

**Examples:**
- *Illō tempore* = **At that time**
- *Prīmā lūce* = **At dawn** (at first light)
- *Aestāte* = **In summer**

### 5. Ablative of Time Within Which

Shows the time period **within which** something occurs.

**Examples:**
- *Paucīs diēbus* = **Within a few days**
- *Tribus annīs* = **Within three years**

### 6. Ablative of Place Where

Shows **where** something is located (with preposition *in*).

**Examples:**
- *In urbe* = **In the city**
- *In agrīs* = **In the fields**

### 7. Ablative of Separation

Shows separation or distance from something (sometimes with *ab, ex, dē*).

**Examples:**
- *Librīs caret.* = He lacks **books** (is separated from books).
- *Ab urbe discēdit.* = He departs **from the city**.

### 8. Ablative of Agent

Shows **by whom** something is done in passive constructions (uses *ab/ā* + ablative).

**Examples:**
- *Ā rēge laudātur.* = He is praised **by the king**.
- *Ab amīcīs vidētur.* = He is seen **by (his) friends**.

**Note:** We haven't fully covered passive voice yet, but this use will be important later.

## Lesson 6.2: Prepositions and Their Cases

Prepositions in Latin govern specific cases. You must memorize which case each preposition takes.

### Prepositions Taking the Accusative

These prepositions answer "where to?" (motion toward).

| Preposition | Meaning | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| ad | to, toward, near | *ad urbem* = toward the city |
| ante | before, in front of | *ante portam* = before the gate |
| apud | among, at the house of | *apud amīcōs* = among friends |
| circum | around | *circum urbem* = around the city |
| contrā | against | *contrā hostēs* = against the enemy |
| in | into, onto | *in urbem* = into the city |
| inter | between, among | *inter mīlitēs* = among soldiers |
| ob | on account of | *ob causam* = on account of the reason |
| per | through, by means of | *per urbem* = through the city |
| post | after, behind | *post bellum* = after the war |
| prope | near | *prope flūmen* = near the river |
| propter | on account of, because of | *propter timōrem* = because of fear |
| trāns | across | *trāns mare* = across the sea |

### Prepositions Taking the Ablative

These prepositions answer "where?" (position) or indicate other relationships.

| Preposition | Meaning | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| ā/ab | from, away from, by | *ab urbe* = from the city |
| cum | with | *cum amīcō* = with a friend |
| dē | down from, about, concerning | *dē bellō* = about the war |
| ē/ex | out of, from | *ex urbe* = out of the city |
| in | in, on | *in urbe* = in the city |
| prō | for, in behalf of, before | *prō patriā* = for the fatherland |
| sine | without | *sine timōre* = without fear |
| sub | under, at the foot of | *sub monte* = under the mountain |

### Special Note: *In* and *Sub*

**In** and **sub** can take **either** accusative or ablative:

- **Accusative** (motion toward/into): *in urbem* = into the city
- **Ablative** (location): *in urbe* = in the city

Same with **sub**:
- **Accusative**: *sub montem* = to under the mountain (motion)
- **Ablative**: *sub monte* = under the mountain (position)

### Memory Aids

**Accusative prepositions** often involve **motion** or **direction**
**Ablative prepositions** often indicate **position** or **separation**

---

## Lesson 6.3: Interrogative Words and Forming Questions

### Yes/No Questions

Latin forms yes/no questions by adding **-ne** to the first word of the sentence (usually the verb or emphasized word).

**Examples:**
- *Amāsne librum?* = Do you love the book?
- *Vidēsne rēgem?* = Do you see the king?
- *Estne pater tuus?* = Is he your father?

**Alternative:** Use **nōnne** (expecting "yes") or **num** (expecting "no"):
- *Nōnne venīs?* = You're coming, aren't you?
- *Num venis?* = You're not coming, are you?

### Interrogative Pronouns and Adjectives

#### *Quis, Quid* = Who? What? (Pronoun)

**Interrogative Pronoun (asking for identity):**

| Case | Masculine/Feminine | Neuter |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| Nom. | quis | quid |
| Gen. | cuius | cuius |
| Dat. | cui | cui |
| Acc. | quem | quid |
| Abl. | quō | quō |

**Examples:**
- *Quis est?* = Who is it?
- *Quid vidēs?* = What do you see?
- *Cuius liber est?* = Whose book is it?

#### *Quī, Quae, Quod* = Which? What? (Adjective)

**Interrogative Adjective (modifying a noun):**

| Case | M. Sg. | F. Sg. | N. Sg. |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| Nom. | quī | quae | quod |
| Gen. | cuius | cuius | cuius |
| Dat. | cui | cui | cui |
| Acc. | quem | quam | quod |
| Abl. | quō | quā | quō |

**Examples:**
- *Quī vir?* = Which man?
- *Quam puellam amās?* = Which girl do you love?
- *Quod bellum?* = Which war?

### Other Interrogative Words

| Latin | English | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| ubi? | where? | *Ubi est pater?* = Where is father? |
| unde? | from where? | *Unde venis?* = From where do you come? |
| quō? | to where? | *Quō īs?* = Where are you going? |
| cūr? | why? | *Cūr labōrās?* = Why do you work? |
| quandō? | when? | *Quandō veniet?* = When will he come? |
| quōmodo? | how? | *Quōmodo labōrās?* = How do you work? |

## Lesson 6.4: Relative Pronouns and Relative Clauses

The **relative pronoun** introduces a **relative clause** (a subordinate clause that describes a noun).

### Relative Pronoun: *Quī, Quae, Quod* = Who, Which, That

| Case | M. Sg. | F. Sg. | N. Sg. | M. Pl. | F. Pl. | N. Pl. |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Nom. | quī | quae | quod | quī | quae | quae |
| Gen. | cuius | cuius | cuius | quōrum | quārum | quōrum |
| Dat. | cui | cui | cui | quibus | quibus | quibus |
| Acc. | quem | quam | quod | quōs | quās | quae |
| Abl. | quō | quā | quō | quibus | quibus | quibus |

**Note:** Same forms as interrogative adjective, but used differently!

### How Relative Clauses Work

A relative pronoun:
1. **Agrees** with its **antecedent** (the noun it refers to) in **gender and number**
2. Takes its **case** from its function **in the relative clause**

### Examples

1. *Puer **quī** librum legit est fīlius meus.*
   - The boy **who** is reading the book is my son.
   - *quī* = masculine singular nominative (agrees with *puer*, subject of *legit*)

2. *Puella **quam** videō est soror tua.*
   - The girl **whom** I see is your sister.
   - *quam* = feminine singular accusative (agrees with *puella*, object of *videō*)

3. *Liber **cuius** nōmen est "Vīta" est bonus.*
   - The book **whose** name is "Life" is good.
   - *cuius* = genitive (possession: "of which")

4. *Mīlitēs **quibus** arma dedimus sunt fortēs.*
   - The soldiers **to whom** we gave arms are brave.
   - *quibus* = masculine plural dative (agrees with *mīlitēs*, indirect object of *dedimus*)

### Translation Tips

1. Find the **antecedent** (the noun the relative pronoun refers to)
2. Determine the relative pronoun's **function** in its clause (subject, object, etc.)
3. Translate the relative clause, then connect it to the main clause

### Roman Education

Roman education (*ēducātiō*) had three stages:

2. **Grammaticus** (grammar school, ages 12-16): Literature, Greek, rhetoric
3. **Rhētor** (rhetoric school, ages 16+): Public speaking, philosophy, law

Only wealthy families could afford advanced education. Girls typically received only primary education at home.
