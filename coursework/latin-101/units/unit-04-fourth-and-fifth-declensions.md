### Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will be able to:
- Decline fourth declension nouns (masculine and neuter)
- Decline fifth declension nouns (mostly feminine)
- Conjugate third and fourth conjugation verbs in the present tense
- Form and translate the future tense for all four conjugations
- Understand time expressions and temporal constructions
- Master approximately 50 additional vocabulary words

---

## Lesson 4.1: Fourth Declension Nouns

The fourth declension is relatively small, consisting primarily of **masculine nouns** ending in **-us** and a few **neuter nouns** ending in **-ū**.

### Fourth Declension Paradigm (Masculine)

**Model: *manus, -ūs* (f.) = hand**

| Case | Singular | Plural | Translation (Sg./Pl.) |
|------|----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Nominative** | man**us** | man**ūs** | the hand / the hands |
| **Genitive** | man**ūs** | man**uum** | of the hand / of the hands |
| **Dative** | man**uī** | man**ibus** | to/for the hand / to/for the hands |
| **Accusative** | man**um** | man**ūs** | the hand (obj.) / the hands (obj.) |
| **Ablative** | man**ū** | man**ibus** | by/with/from the hand / by/with/from the hands |
| **Vocative** | man**us** | man**ūs** | O hand! / O hands! |

### Key Features

- **Genitive singular:** -ūs (with long ū) - distinguishes from 2nd declension -ī
- **Nominative = Genitive in plural:** both are -ūs
- Primarily **masculine**, but some important feminine nouns (*manus, domus*)

### Fourth Declension Paradigm (Neuter)

**Model: *cornū, -ūs* (n.) = horn**

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nom. | corn**ū** | corn**ua** |
| Gen. | corn**ūs** | corn**uum** |
| Dat. | corn**ū** | corn**ibus** |
| Acc. | corn**ū** | corn**ua** |
| Abl. | corn**ū** | corn**ibus** |

**Neuter rule applies:** Nom. = Acc., plural in -ua

### Common Fourth Declension Nouns

| Latin | Genitive | Gender | English |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| exercitus | exercitūs | m. | army |
| manus | manūs | f. | hand, band of men |
| portus | portūs | m. | port, harbor |
| senātus | senātūs | m. | senate |
| domus | domūs | f. | house, home |
| cornū | cornūs | n. | horn, wing (of army) |
| genū | genūs | n. | knee |

### Special Note: *Domus*

The word *domus* (house, home) has alternative forms mixing 2nd and 4th declensions:

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nom. | domus | domūs |
| Gen. | domūs (or domī) | domuum (or domōrum) |
| Dat. | domuī (or domō) | domibus |
| Acc. | domum | domūs (or domōs) |
| Abl. | domū (or domō) | domibus |

**Special locative:** *domī* = at home

---

## Lesson 4.2: Fifth Declension Nouns

The fifth declension is the smallest declension, consisting almost entirely of **feminine nouns** ending in **-ēs**.

### Fifth Declension Paradigm

**Model: *rēs, reī* (f.) = thing, matter, affair**

| Case | Singular | Plural | Translation (Sg./Pl.) |
|------|----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Nominative** | r**ēs** | r**ēs** | the thing / the things |
| **Genitive** | r**eī** | r**ērum** | of the thing / of the things |
| **Dative** | r**eī** | r**ēbus** | to/for the thing / to/for the things |
| **Accusative** | r**em** | r**ēs** | the thing (obj.) / the things (obj.) |
| **Ablative** | r**ē** | r**ēbus** | by/with/from the thing / by/with/from the things |
| **Vocative** | r**ēs** | r**ēs** | O thing! / O things! |

### Key Features

- **Genitive/Dative singular:** both are -eī (with long ē, diphthong eī)
- **Nominative = Accusative plural:** both are -ēs
- Almost all **feminine** (exception: *diēs* can be masculine)

### Common Fifth Declension Nouns

| Latin | Genitive | Gender | English |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| rēs | reī | f. | thing, matter, affair |
| diēs | diēī | m./f. | day |
| fidēs | fideī | f. | faith, trust |
| spēs | speī | f. | hope |
| aciēs | aciēī | f. | line of battle, sharp edge |

### Important Phrases

- *rēs pūblica* = the republic, the state (literally "public thing")
- *rēs gestae* = deeds, accomplishments (things done)

## Lesson 4.3: Third Conjugation Verbs - Present Tense

Third conjugation verbs have a **short -e-** or **consonant** before the personal endings.

### Third Conjugation Paradigm

**Model: *dūcō, dūcere, dūxī, ductum*** = to lead

Find the stem by removing **-ere** from infinitive: *dūc-*

| Person | Singular | English | Plural | English |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1st | dūc**ō** | I lead | dūc**imus** | we lead |
| 2nd | dūc**is** | you lead | dūc**itis** | you (pl.) lead |
| 3rd | dūc**it** | he/she/it leads | dūc**unt** | they lead |

### Key Differences from 1st and 2nd Conjugations

| Person | 1st (amō) | 2nd (moneō) | 3rd (dūcō) |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 1st Sg. | am**ō** | mone**ō** | dūc**ō** |
| 2nd Sg. | amā**s** | monē**s** | dūc**is** |
| 3rd Sg. | ama**t** | mone**t** | dūc**it** |
| 1st Pl. | amā**mus** | monē**mus** | dūc**imus** |
| 2nd Pl. | amā**tis** | monē**tis** | dūc**itis** |
| 3rd Pl. | ama**nt** | mone**nt** | dūc**unt** |

**Note:** The stem vowel **-i-** appears in most forms except 1st singular

### Common Third Conjugation Verbs

| Latin | Principal Parts | English |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| agō | agere, ēgī, āctum | to do, drive, act |
| dīcō | dīcere, dīxī, dictum | to say, tell |
| dūcō | dūcere, dūxī, ductum | to lead |
| legō | legere, lēgī, lēctum | to read, choose |
| mittō | mittere, mīsī, missum | to send |

| trahō | trahere, trāxī, tractum | to drag, draw |
| vincō | vincere, vīcī, victum | to conquer, win |
| vīvō | vīvere, vīxī, vīctum | to live |

## Lesson 4.4: Third Conjugation -iō Verbs (Fourth Conjugation)

Some third conjugation verbs have **-iō** in the first person singular and are sometimes called **3rd -iō** or **4th conjugation** verbs.

### Fourth Conjugation Paradigm

**Model: *capiō, capere, cēpī, captum*** = to take, capture

| Person | Singular | English | Plural | English |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1st | capi**ō** | I take | cap**imus** | we take |
| 2nd | cap**is** | you take | cap**itis** | you (pl.) take |
| 3rd | cap**it** | he/she/it takes | capi**unt** | they take |

### Distinguishing 3rd -iō Verbs

- **1st person singular:** ends in **-iō** (not just -ō)
- **3rd person plural:** ends in **-iunt** (not just -unt)
- **Infinitive:** ends in **-ere** (short e, like regular 3rd conjugation)

### Common Third -iō / Fourth Conjugation Verbs

| Latin | Principal Parts | English |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| capiō | capere, cēpī, captum | to take, capture |
| faciō | facere, fēcī, factum | to make, do |
| fugiō | fugere, fūgī, fugitum | to flee |
| iaciō | iacere, iēcī, iactum | to throw |
| rapiō | rapere, rapuī, raptum | to seize, snatch |

### True Fourth Conjugation Verbs

True fourth conjugation verbs have **-īre** infinitive (long ī):

**Model: *audiō, audīre, audīvī, audītum*** = to hear

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | audi**ō** | aud**īmus** |
| 2nd | aud**īs** | aud**ītis** |
| 3rd | aud**it** | audi**unt** |

**Common 4th conjugation verbs:**
- *audiō, audīre* = to hear
- *veniō, venīre* = to come
- *sentiō, sentīre* = to feel, perceive

---

## Lesson 4.5: Future Tense - All Conjugations

The **future tense** describes actions that **will happen** in the future.

### Formation: Two Patterns

Latin has **two different formations** for the future tense:

1. **First and Second Conjugations:** Use **-bi-** (with variations)
2. **Third and Fourth Conjugations:** Use **-a-/-e-** vowel changes

### Future Tense: First and Second Conjugations

**Formation:** Present stem + **-bi-** + personal endings

**First Conjugation: *amō, amāre***

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | amā**bō** | amā**bimus** |
| 2nd | amā**bis** | amā**bitis** |
| 3rd | amā**bit** | amā**bunt** |

**Second Conjugation: *moneō, monēre***

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | monē**bō** | monē**bimus** |
| 2nd | monē**bis** | monē**bitis** |
| 3rd | monē**bit** | monē**bunt** |

**Memory aid:** The -bi- changes to -bo, -bi, -bi, -bi, -bi, -bu

### Future Tense: Third and Fourth Conjugations

**Formation:** Present stem + **-a-/-e-** vowel + personal endings

**Third Conjugation: *dūcō, dūcere***

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | dūc**am** | dūc**ēmus** |
| 2nd | dūc**ēs** | dūc**ētis** |
| 3rd | dūc**et** | dūc**ent** |

**Fourth Conjugation: *audiō, audīre***

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | audi**am** | audi**ēmus** |
| 2nd | audi**ēs** | audi**ētis** |
| 3rd | audi**et** | audi**ent** |

**Memory aid:** Use **-a-** in 1st person singular, **-e-** everywhere else

### Future of *Sum*

The verb *sum* has its own future forms:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | erō | erimus |
| 2nd | eris | eritis |
| 3rd | erit | erunt |

**Translation:** *Erō* = I will be, *Erit* = he/she/it will be, etc.

### Translation

Future tense is straightforward in English:

- *Amābō* = I will love
- *Dūcēs* = You will lead
- *Audient* = They will hear

## Cultural Notes

### The Roman Senate

The *senātus* was the governing and advisory council of Rome:

- **Composition:** 300 senators (later increased to 600, then 900)
- **Membership:** Former magistrates, appointed for life
- **Function:** Advisory body that effectively controlled policy
- **Power:** Though technically advisory, the senate's *auctōritās* (authority) was immense

**Famous phrase:** *Senātus Populusque Rōmānus* (SPQR) = The Senate and People of Rome

### The Roman Calendar

Romans organized time differently than we do:

#### Days of the Month

Romans counted backwards from three fixed points:
- **Kalendae** (Kalends) = 1st day of the month
- **Nōnae** (Nones) = 5th or 7th day
- **Īdūs** (Ides) = 13th or 15th day

Example: "Three days before the Ides of March" = March 13

#### Days of the Week

Named after celestial bodies (adopted later):
- *Diēs Sōlis* (Sun-day)
- *Diēs Lūnae* (Moon-day = Monday)
- *Diēs Martis* (Mars-day = Mardi/Tuesday)
- *Diēs Mercuriī* (Mercury-day = Mercredi/Wednesday)
- *Diēs Iovis* (Jupiter-day = Jeudi/Thursday)
- *Diēs Veneris* (Venus-day = Vendredi/Friday)
- *Diēs Saturnī* (Saturn-day)

### Roman Military Tactics

The Roman *exercitus* used sophisticated formations:

- **Testūdō** (tortoise) = Shields locked overhead and on sides
- **Triplex aciēs** = Triple line of battle
- **Cuneus** = Wedge formation for breaking enemy lines
