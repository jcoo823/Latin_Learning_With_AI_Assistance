## Lesson 3.1: Third Declension Consonant Stems

The third declension is the largest and most diverse declension in Latin. Unlike first and second declensions, third declension nouns have various stem endings.

### Key Characteristics

- **Genitive singular always ends in -is**
- Nouns can be **masculine, feminine, or neuter**
- The **base/stem** is found by removing **-is** from the genitive singular
- Gender must be memorized (not predictable from endings)

### Third Declension Paradigm (Masculine/Feminine Consonant Stem)

**Model: *rēx, rēgis* (m.) = king**

| Case | Singular | Plural | Translation (Sg./Pl.) |
|------|----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Nominative** | rēx | rēg**ēs** | the king / the kings |
| **Genitive** | rēg**is** | rēg**um** | of the king / of the kings |
| **Dative** | rēg**ī** | rēg**ibus** | to/for the king / to/for the kings |
| **Accusative** | rēg**em** | rēg**ēs** | the king (obj.) / the kings (obj.) |
| **Ablative** | rēg**e** | rēg**ibus** | by/with/from the king / by/with/from the kings |
| **Vocative** | rēx | rēg**ēs** | O king! / O kings! |

### Finding the Stem

**Example: *rēx, rēgis* (m.) = king**
- Genitive singular: *rēg-is*
- Remove **-is**: stem = *rēg-*
- Add endings to *rēg-*

### Memory Aid: Consonant Stem Endings (M/F)

**Singular:** -, -is, -ī, -em, -e  
**Plural:** -ēs, -um, -ibus, -ēs, -ibus

### Common Third Declension M/F Consonant Stem Nouns

| Latin | Genitive | Gender | English |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| rēx | rēgis | m. | king |
| dux | ducis | m. | leader, general |
| pater | patris | m. | father |
| māter | mātris | f. | mother |
| frāter | frātris | m. | brother |
| soror | sorōris | f. | sister |
| homō | hominis | m. | human being, man |
| leō | leōnis | m. | lion |
| virgō | virginis | f. | maiden, virgin |
| mīles | mīlitis | m. | soldier |
| pēs | pedis | m. | foot |
| nōmen | nōminis | n. | name |

## Lesson 3.2: Third Declension Neuter Nouns

Third declension neuter nouns follow the **neuter rule**: nominative = accusative, and nominative/accusative plural ends in **-a**.

### Third Declension Paradigm (Neuter Consonant Stem)

**Model: *corpus, corporis* (n.) = body**

| Case | Singular | Plural | Translation (Sg./Pl.) |
|------|----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Nominative** | corpus | corpor**a** | the body / the bodies |
| **Genitive** | corpor**is** | corpor**um** | of the body / of the bodies |
| **Dative** | corpor**ī** | corpor**ibus** | to/for the body / to/for the bodies |
| **Accusative** | corpus | corpor**a** | the body (obj.) / the bodies (obj.) |
| **Ablative** | corpor**e** | corpor**ibus** | by/with/from the body / by/with/from the bodies |
| **Vocative** | corpus | corpor**a** | O body! / O bodies! |

### Common Third Declension Neuter Nouns

| Latin | Genitive | English |
|-------|----------|---------|
| caput | capitis | head |
| corpus | corporis | body |
| genus | generis | kind, type, race |
| nōmen | nōminis | name |
| opus | operis | work, task |
| tempus | temporis | time |
| vulnus | vulneris | wound |

## Lesson 3.3: Third Declension I-Stems

Some third declension nouns have an **-i-** in certain endings. These are called **i-stems**.

### I-Stem Characteristics

I-stem nouns typically are:
1. **Parisyllabic** nouns (same number of syllables in nom. and gen.): *cīvis, cīvis*
2. Nouns with nominative ending in **-is** or **-ēs**: *nāvis, nāvis*
3. Neuter nouns ending in **-e, -al, -ar**: *mare, maris*

### Third Declension I-Stem Paradigm (M/F)

**Model: *cīvis, cīvis* (m./f.) = citizen**

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nom. | cīvis | cīv**ēs** |
| Gen. | cīv**is** | cīv**ium** (note: -ium) |
| Dat. | cīv**ī** | cīv**ibus** |
| Acc. | cīv**em** | cīv**ēs** (or -īs) |
| Abl. | cīv**e** (or -ī) | cīv**ibus** |

**Key differences from consonant stems:**
- Genitive plural: **-ium** (not -um)
- Ablative singular sometimes: **-ī** (especially in adjectives)
- Accusative plural sometimes: **-īs** (less common)

### Third Declension I-Stem Paradigm (Neuter)

**Model: *mare, maris* (n.) = sea**

| Case | Singular | Plural |
|------|----------|--------|
| Nom. | mare | mar**ia** |
| Gen. | mar**is** | mar**ium** |
| Dat. | mar**ī** | mar**ibus** |
| Acc. | mare | mar**ia** |
| Abl. | mar**ī** | mar**ibus** |

**Key differences:**
- Ablative singular: **-ī** (not -e)
- Nominative/Accusative plural: **-ia** (not -a)
- Genitive plural: **-ium** (not -um)

### Common I-Stem Nouns

| Latin | Genitive | Gender | English |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| cīvis | cīvis | m./f. | citizen |
| hostis | hostis | m. | enemy (in war) |
| nāvis | nāvis | f. | ship |
| animal | animālis | n. | animal |
| mare | maris | n. | sea |

## Lesson 3.4: The Genitive Case - Possession

The **genitive case** primarily expresses **possession** or **relationship**.

### Basic Uses of the Genitive

#### 1. Possessive Genitive

Shows ownership or possession:

- *liber magistrī* = the teacher's book (the book of the teacher)
- *nōmen rēgis* = the king's name (the name of the king)
- *amor patris* = the father's love (the love of the father)

#### 2. Partitive Genitive

Indicates the whole from which a part is taken:

- *pars urbis* = part of the city
- *multī mīlitum* = many of the soldiers

#### 3. Descriptive Genitive

Describes a quality or characteristic:

- *vir magnī animī* = a man of great spirit
- *puella magnae fortūnae* = a girl of great fortune

### Word Order with Genitive

In Latin, the genitive usually **follows** the noun it modifies:

- *fīlius rēgis* = the son of the king
- *corpus hominis* = the body of a man

### Translation Tips

English "of" construction works, but possessive forms are often more natural:

- *domus virī* = the house of the man → the man's house
- *verbum deī* = the word of god → god's word

---

## Lesson 3.5: The Dative Case - Indirect Objects

The **dative case** primarily expresses the **indirect object** - the person/thing to whom or for whom something is done.

### Basic Uses of the Dative

#### 1. Indirect Object

The recipient of the direct object:

**Pattern: Subject + Verb + Indirect Object (Dat.) + Direct Object (Acc.)**

- *Magister puerō librum dat.* = The teacher gives a book **to the boy**.
  - *magister* = subject (nom.)
  - *dat* = gives
  - *puerō* = indirect object (dat.)
  - *librum* = direct object (acc.)

More examples:
- *Fīlius patrī dōnum portat.* = The son brings a gift **to (his) father**.
- *Rēx populō auxilium dat.* = The king gives aid **to the people**.

#### 2. Dative with Special Verbs

Certain verbs take a **dative object** rather than accusative:

- *crēdō* + dative = believe, trust
  - *Crēdō magistrō.* = I trust the teacher.

- *noceō* + dative = harm
  - *Bellum populō nocet.* = War harms the people.

- *placeō* + dative = please
  - *Dōnum puellae placet.* = The gift pleases the girl.

#### 3. Dative of Possession

With *sum*, the dative can show possession (alternative to genitive):

- *Mihi est liber.* = To me there is a book → I have a book.
- *Rēgī sunt mīlitēs.* = To the king there are soldiers → The king has soldiers.

### Common Dative Uses Summary

| Use | Example | Translation |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| Indirect Object | *Dat puerō librum* | He gives a book to the boy |
| With Special Verbs | *Crēdō amīcō* | I trust the friend |
| Possession | *Mihi est pecūnia* | I have money |

## Lesson 3.6: Second Conjugation Verbs - Present Tense

Second conjugation verbs have an **-ē-** stem vowel (before the personal endings).

### Second Conjugation Paradigm

**Model: *moneō, monēre, monuī, monitum*** = to warn, advise

Find the present stem: *monē-* (from infinitive *mon**ē**re*)

| Person | Singular | English | Plural | English |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1st | mone**ō** | I warn | monē**mus** | we warn |
| 2nd | monē**s** | you warn | monē**tis** | you (pl.) warn |
| 3rd | mone**t** | he/she/it warns | mone**nt** | they warn |

### Comparison: First vs. Second Conjugation

| Person | 1st Conj. (amō) | 2nd Conj. (moneō) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1st Sg. | am**ō** | mone**ō** |
| 2nd Sg. | amā**s** | monē**s** |
| 3rd Sg. | ama**t** | mone**t** |
| 1st Pl. | amā**mus** | monē**mus** |
| 2nd Pl. | amā**tis** | monē**tis** |
| 3rd Pl. | ama**nt** | mone**nt** |

**Key difference:** Stem vowel (**-ā-** vs. **-ē-**)

### Common Second Conjugation Verbs

| Latin | Principal Parts | English |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| habeō | habēre, habuī, habitum | to have, hold |
| moneō | monēre, monuī, monitum | to warn, advise |
| terreō | terrēre, terruī, territum | to frighten, terrify |
| timeō | timēre, timuī | to fear, be afraid |
| videō | vidēre, vīdī, vīsum | to see |
| dēbeō | dēbēre, dēbuī, dēbitum | to owe, ought |
| doceō | docēre, docuī, doctum | to teach |
| moveō | movēre, mōvī, mōtum | to move |
| respondeō | respondēre, respondī, respōnsum | to respond, answer |
| teneō | tenēre, tenuī, tentum | to hold, keep |

## Lesson 3.7: Imperfect Tense - All Conjugations

The **imperfect tense** describes **ongoing, repeated, or habitual actions in the past**.

### Formation: Present Stem + **-bā-** + Personal Endings

The imperfect tense is formed by:
1. Taking the **present stem**
2. Adding **-bā-** (imperfect tense marker)
3. Adding personal endings: **-m, -s, -t, -mus, -tis, -nt**

### First Conjugation Imperfect

**Model: *amō, amāre***

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | amā**ba**m | amābā**mus** |
| 2nd | amābā**s** | amābā**tis** |
| 3rd | amāba**t** | amāba**nt** |

### Second Conjugation Imperfect

**Model: *moneō, monēre***

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | monē**ba**m | monēbā**mus** |
| 2nd | monēbā**s** | monēbā**tis** |
| 3rd | monēba**t** | monēba**nt** |

### Translation of Imperfect Tense

The imperfect can be translated in three ways:

1. **Ongoing action:** *Amābam* = I was loving
2. **Repeated action:** *Amābam* = I used to love / I kept loving
3. **Attempted action:** *Amābam* = I tried to love

Choose the translation that best fits the context.

### Examples

1. *Puer librum legēbat.* = The boy was reading the book.
2. *Magistrī puerōs monēbant.* = The teachers used to warn the boys.
3. *Rēx populum habēbat.* = The king was ruling the people.
4. *Mīlitēs fortiter pugnābant.* = The soldiers were fighting bravely.

### Imperfect of *Sum*

The verb *sum* has a special imperfect:

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | eram | erāmus |
| 2nd | erās | erātis |
| 3rd | erat | erant |

**Translation:** *Eram* = I was, *Erat* = he/she/it was, etc.
