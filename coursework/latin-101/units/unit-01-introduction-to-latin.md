## Lesson 1.1: The Latin Language and Alphabet

### Historical Context

Latin was the language of ancient Rome and the Roman Empire, spoken from approximately 750 BCE to 1500 CE in its living forms. It evolved into the Romance languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian) and profoundly influenced English vocabulary (approximately 60% of English words have Latin roots).

### The Latin Alphabet

The classical Latin alphabet contains **23 letters**:

**A B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X Y Z**

Note: The letters **J, U, and W** did not exist in classical Latin:
- **I** served for both vowel *i* and consonantal *j* sounds
- **V** served for both vowel *u* and consonantal *v* sounds
- **Y** and **Z** were borrowed from Greek for Greek loanwords

### Pronunciation Guide (Classical)

#### Vowels

Latin has 6 vowel sounds (5 letters with long and short variations):

| Letter | Short Sound | Long Sound | Example |
|--------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **A** | *ah* (father) | *ah* (longer) | *ămo* (I love), *cārus* (dear) |
| **E** | *eh* (pet) | *ay* (they) | *ĕst* (is), *mē* (me) |
| **I** | *ih* (bit) | *ee* (meet) | *ĭn* (in), *vīta* (life) |
| **O** | *oh* (cost) | *oh* (longer) | *bŏnus* (good), *nōn* (not) |
| **U** | *oo* (put) | *oo* (boot) | *tŭm* (then), *dūrus* (hard) |
| **Y** | *ü* (French *u*) | *ü* (longer) | *lyra* (lyre) |

*Note: Macrons (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū) indicate long vowels in teaching materials but were not used in classical texts.*

#### Diphthongs

Diphthongs are two vowels pronounced as one syllable:

| Diphthong | Sound | Example |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **ae** | *eye* (aisle) | *caelum* (sky) |
| **au** | *ow* (how) | *aurum* (gold) |
| **ei** | *ay* (day) | *deinde* (then) |
| **eu** | *eh-oo* | *heu* (alas!) |
| **oe** | *oy* (boy) | *poena* (punishment) |
| **ui** | *oo-ee* | *cui* (to whom) |

#### Consonants

Most consonants are pronounced as in English, with these exceptions:

| Letter | Sound | Notes | Example |
|--------|-------|-------|---------|
| **C** | always *k* (never *s*) | Like "cat," never "city" | *circus* = KEER-koos |
| **G** | always hard *g* | Like "get," never "gem" | *genus* = GEH-noos |
| **V** | *w* sound | Pronounced as English *w* | *veni* = WEH-nee |
| **I** (consonantal) | *y* sound | When before vowel | *iustitia* = yoo-STEE-tee-ah |
| **R** | trilled *r* | Rolled or flipped | *Roma* (roll the R) |
| **S** | always *s* | Never *z* sound | *rosa* = ROH-sah |

**Double consonants** are pronounced with emphasis: *terra* = TEHR-rah (hold the double R)

#### Syllable Stress

1. **Two-syllable words:** Stress the first syllable
   - *ā́mo* (I love), *pú̄er* (boy)

2. **Three+ syllable words:** Follow the penult rule:
   - If the **second-to-last syllable** is long, stress it: *amī́cus* (friend)
   - If short, stress the **third-to-last syllable**: *dó̆minus* (master)

---

## Lesson 1.2: Basic Sentence Structure and Cases

### Latin Word Order

Unlike English, Latin is a **highly inflected language**. Word endings show grammatical function, allowing flexible word order.

**Typical pattern:** Subject - Object - Verb (SOV)

**Example:**
- *Puella rosam amat.* = The girl loves the rose.
  - *Puella* (girl) = subject
  - *rosam* (rose) = object
  - *amat* (loves) = verb

But you could also say: *Rosam puella amat* (emphasizing the rose) or *Amat puella rosam* (emphasizing the action).

### The Case System

Latin uses **6 cases** to show how words function in sentences:

| Case | Primary Function | English Equivalent | Example |
|------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Nominative** | Subject | "The girl runs" | *puella* |
| **Genitive** | Possession | "of the girl" | *puellae* |
| **Dative** | Indirect object | "to/for the girl" | *puellae* |
| **Accusative** | Direct object | "the girl" (obj.) | *puellam* |
| **Ablative** | Various (by/with/from) | "by the girl" | *puellā* |
| **Vocative** | Direct address | "O girl!" | *puella* |

**Key Concept:** The ending of a noun tells you its function in the sentence, not its position.

---

## Lesson 1.3: First Declension Nouns

The first declension consists primarily of **feminine nouns** ending in **-a** in the nominative singular.

### First Declension Paradigm

**Model: *puella, -ae* (f.) = girl**

| Case | Singular | Plural | Translation (Sg./Pl.) |
|------|----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Nominative** | puell**a** | puell**ae** | the girl / the girls |
| **Genitive** | puell**ae** | puell**ārum** | of the girl / of the girls |
| **Dative** | puell**ae** | puell**īs** | to/for the girl / to/for the girls |
| **Accusative** | puell**am** | puell**ās** | the girl (obj.) / the girls (obj.) |
| **Ablative** | puell**ā** | puell**īs** | by/with/from the girl / by/with/from the girls |
| **Vocative** | puell**a** | puell**ae** | O girl! / O girls! |

### Memory Aid: Singular Endings

**-a, -ae, -ae, -am, -ā, -a**

### Common First Declension Nouns

| Latin | Genitive | Gender | English |
|-------|----------|--------|---------|
| *aqua* | *aquae* | f. | water |
| *fēmina* | *fēminae* | f. | woman |
| *fīlia* | *fīliae* | f. | daughter |
| *fortūna* | *fortūnae* | f. | fortune, luck |
| *puella* | *puellae* | f. | girl |
| *rosa* | *rosae* | f. | rose |
| *terra* | *terrae* | f. | earth, land |
| *vīta* | *vītae* | f. | life |
| *via* | *viae* | f. | road, way |
| *īra* | *īrae* | f. | anger |

**Note:** A few first declension nouns are **masculine**, typically occupations:
- *nauta, -ae* (m.) = sailor
- *poēta, -ae* (m.) = poet
- *agricola, -ae* (m.) = farmer

### Practice: Decline These Nouns

Try declining *terra, -ae* (f.) = earth, land

## Lesson 1.4: The Verb *Sum* (to be)

The verb **sum, esse, fuī, futūrus** = "to be" is **irregular** but extremely important.

### Present Tense of *Sum*

| Person | Singular | English | Plural | English |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| 1st | **sum** | I am | **sumus** | we are |
| 2nd | **es** | you are | **estis** | you (pl.) are |
| 3rd | **est** | he/she/it is | **sunt** | they are |

### Example Sentences

1. *Puella est.* = The girl is / She is.
2. *Puellae sunt.* = The girls are / They are.
3. *Sum fēmina.* = I am a woman.
4. *Sumus poētae.* = We are poets.

**Note:** Latin doesn't require "a/an":
- *Sum poēta.* = I am a poet.

### Predicate Nominative

With *sum*, the **complement** (word after the verb) is in the **nominative case**, not accusative:

- *Puella est poēta.* = The girl is a poet.
  - Both *puella* and *poēta* are nominative.

---

## Lesson 1.5: Simple Sentences and Translation

### Basic Sentence Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Subject + *sum*
- *Puella est.* = The girl is.
- *Poētae sunt.* = The poets are.

#### Pattern 2: Subject + *sum* + Predicate Nominative
- *Fīlia est puella.* = The daughter is a girl.
- *Nautae sunt virī.* = The sailors are men.

#### Pattern 3: Subject + *sum* + Adjective (introduced later)
- We'll add adjectives in Unit 5.

### Translation Tips

1. **Identify the verb** first (the action or state of being)
2. **Find the subject** (nominative case)
3. **Determine other elements** (objects, complements)
4. **Check word endings** to understand relationships
5. **Consider context** for best English phrasing

### Example Translations

**Latin to English:**

1. *Vīta est via.* 
   - *vīta* (nom. sg.) = life (subject)
   - *est* = is
   - *via* (nom. sg.) = a way (predicate nominative)
   - **Translation:** Life is a way.

2. *Fēminae sunt poētae.*
   - *fēminae* (nom. pl.) = women (subject)
   - *sunt* = are
   - *poētae* (nom. pl.) = poets (predicate nominative)
   - **Translation:** The women are poets.

**English to Latin:**

1. "Water is life."
   - Water (subject) = *aqua* (nom. sg.)
   - is = *est*
   - life (predicate nom.) = *vīta* (nom. sg.)
   - **Translation:** *Aqua est vīta.*

2. "The daughters are girls."
   - The daughters (subject) = *fīliae* (nom. pl.)
   - are = *sunt*
   - girls (predicate nom.) = *puellae* (nom. pl.)
   - **Translation:** *Fīliae sunt puellae.*
